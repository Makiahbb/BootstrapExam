        <p>The <i>Nintendo Entertainment System </i>(NES) is the 1st device of Nintendo. The original name was called: Famicom. And uses a wired rectangular controller. The purpose the controllers were hard-wired to the console with no connectors are for cost reasons. Many changes were made to the overall design because of comfort, cost and functionality. The original design was going to be closer related to a computer though as you can see it was changed to a cartridge console/system. The games (which were largely based on arcade games) Nintendo introduced using this system were groundbreaking, quickly becoming popular. Games include Mario, Donkey Kong, Pacman etc. 62 Mil+ have been sold since it's time. This made it to be the most popular system during it’s time. Although it looks different it has most of the games, we see played on other Nintendo systems. This system, unlike the other consoles (PS & Xbox) does not have a disk port even though its function is similar. The graphics are a much older version of it’s newer systems, in which you can tell a noticeable difference from devices about five or so years later. Even though it’s old some are still bought today. When it first came out the cost was originally around $200-$500. Although now the payment for this is usually around $50-$130 depending on where you look to buy it from. On August 14, 1995, Nintendo discontinued it in both North America and Europe. And later (2007) discontinued in Japan due to a shortage of available parts. </p>
